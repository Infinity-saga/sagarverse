# 🌌 SagarVerse — The Digital Realm of Sagar

Welcome to **SagarVerse**, an artistic universe born from passion, imagination, and the love for anime.

This project transforms Sagar’s hand-drawn sketches into a **living digital world** — where every line, shadow, and color tells a story.  
It’s more than just a gallery — it’s a cinematic experience designed to blend art, emotion, and technology.
